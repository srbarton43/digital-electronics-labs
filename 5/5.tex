\subsection*{Deliverable 9: Reflections}
For me, the most difficult steps of the process were designing the FSM and writing the timing logic for the testbenches.

For the FSM, I initially didn't include the waiting states between loading the numbers and displaying the sums which would not have been per spec.
However, this ended up being a quick fix because I just had to add those intermediate states.
Another bug that I discovered was that I used the output pin, reset\_signal, interchangeably with the input port, clear\_port, since they had similar names.
This slight error led to difficult to find errors in the elaboration step. 
The most difficult step was writing the testbench for the controller.
Initially, I was not monopulsing the button inputs which led to unexpected behavior with the FSM states.
Once realizing this however, I had to make sure to sync these button presses with the clock period.
Once writing the testbench for the full design, I also had to take in account the slower clock pulse from the clock divider, which in turn, complicated the timing.
